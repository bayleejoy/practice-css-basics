      <p>Graduation is a huge component of the Spring in Blacksburg. It's the only thing that seniors are focused on during the semester--besides finding a job.</p>

      <p>When there's free time outside of all the stress of closing out the year strong, you'll find most students at the local bars finding relaxation with friends. The most popular spot during the warm weather is Sharkey's due to its outside seating.</p>

        <p>
          Before we go anywhere, let's get this one thing straight: <strong>
          Ghosts are evil.</strong> Why? Because we said so. Specifically, we
          have decided that ghosts aren't human, but they're (at least somewhat)
          intelligent, so they must be evil. Don't question us, we're
          <em>totally</em> experts on this completely unexplored and
          unexperimented field! We made our assumptions long before we ever saw
          any ghosts, and once ghosts did start popping up, we immediately began
          biasing our observations in accordance to our assumptions, so we are
          always right. That's definitely how science works.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, what we see is that we are very bad at identifying ghosts,
          which is probably due to the fact that most of them move very quickly
          and are difficult to pin down, especially when they're fighting.

          Here is where I'd put an obligatory joke about how "X marks the spot"
          if I were really bad at unoriginal jokes and really good at making
          people very exasperated. We don't know very much about this ghost
          because we always shoot before we ask qustions, like we do with all
          ghosts. What do you mean this means we never get a chance to talk to
          and actually learn about the ghost. Why would we ever need to do that
          when we already know all we need to know about ghosts (that they're
          EVIL and probably here to make us miserable)?

          Listen, we're super bad at naming ghosts. You should've gotten that
          impression from the fact that the first one is literally called
          Ghost X. This is kind of a placeholder for until we make up names for
          all the other recurring and non-recurring ghosts we see. Sometimes
          they yell what they call themselves but those aren't real names
          because they gave those names to themselves and clearly only humans
          (which ghosts are not, even though they can sometimes come from dead
          people, because once you die you're evil, obviously; have you never
          read about Moldyshorts and his Gravechewers?) can give actual
          valid names.

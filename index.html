      <p>Well, you did say we can put anything we want here. Hopefully you won't come to regret that decision after being forced to read all the random thoughts that run through my head while I'm working -- and I have severe ADD so you're in for a wild ride.</p>
      <p>Additionally, please disregard the mac and cheese at the top of the page. It's getting close to dinnertime and I'm really craving it so that's the image I chose.</p>
      <p>I'm really looking forward to getting back to work at Victory Brewing Co. in Philadelphia this summer. My all-time favorite beer, Cloud Walker, is brewed there. Since they don't distribute it this far south, I've been trying to make do with VooDoo Ranger Juicy Haze IPA, but it's just not the same.</p>

      <h2>More of My Rambling</h2>

      <p>African Grey Parrots are wonderfully intelligent birds that I am very fond of. I have one of my own, named Roxie, who is about to turn 12 in June, but she is not the one in the picture. The one you see here actually lives at the Knoxville Zoo in Tennessee and is named Einstein. Parrots make very rewarding, life-long companions. I'm not kidding, some species can live up to 80 years. An African Grey's cognitive abilites are comparable to a 3-year-old human child's, while their emotional capacity is equivalent to a 7-year-old's.</p>

      <h2>You're Almost Done Listening To Me</h2>

      <p>Old news, but I'm still heartbroken that Nick Foles left us for the Jaguars. Yes, Carson Wentz is the franchise quarterback, but Nick Foles was the one who gave Philadelphia our first Super Bowl win -- over the New England Patriots of all teams. That's something that brands your name forever. While Wentz is a better player, I believe that the team as a whole fights harder to protect Foles when he's in the game. I don't know, man. This is just me rambling about football when we're still months away from the season even starting.
